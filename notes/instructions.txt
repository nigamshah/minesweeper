Here are the specifications for the minesweeper we'd like you to do for us:
- language:
	in AS3
	you can do a air application or a web page containing the game
- optional libraries
	use Starling for the display (http://gamua.com/starling/)
	use feathers for UI elements (http://feathersui.com/)

- flow:
	launch the game
	select a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
	play a round: click to reveal a case, figure out a way to mark mines (maybe press CTRL + click)
	you win -> "you win" message
	you lose -> "you lose" message
	ask the user to start again

Graphic interface does not need much refinement, just enough to play it,
we will make sure it works as expected and mostly look at the code.
In particular I would like to see your implementation of an MVC.
In general we are looking for clean code organization, separation of concern,
a little bit of object oriented programming and clear model / view separation.

Please publish the code on github and send us the link,
if you can host a playable version of the game that would also be helpful.
Make sure you include everyone in this email so it can get reviewed as soon as possible.
